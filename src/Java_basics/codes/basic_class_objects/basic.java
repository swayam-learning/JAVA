//        object is a real world entity and classes are collection of objects and has state,identity and behaviour.
//        a class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an object.
//        inheritance when one object acquires all the properties from it's parent object.
//        if one task is performed differently then it is called as polymorphism.
//        java performs polymorphism using method overloading and method overriding
//        abstraction is basically hiding details and showing only meaningful parts
//        encapsulation is the binding of all the code and data together
//        Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance.
    }
}
// why do we use static keyword?
//becuase then we don't have to call an object for the main method
